This is a simple Twitter bot that is used to get points from Marriott Rewards through tweets.

To use this, simply clone the repo, create a new Twitter account or use an existing one, go to 
dev.twitter.com and create a new app, create your OAUTH keys, make a credentials.py file that
contains your consumer/secret keys, and run the script. You can link your Twitter account to
Marriot here: https://mrpoints.chirpify.com/rewardspoints/register
